# actions/checkout will actually checkout the head of our PR and then automatically merge it against the base this PR is against 
# so if we open a PR against master, actions/checkout will checkout our branch, then merge it against master for us

# By default, the jobs in your workflow all run in parallel at the same time. If you have a job that must only run after another job has completed, 
# you can use the needs keyword to create this dependency. If one of the jobs fails, all dependent jobs are skipped; 
# however, if you need the jobs to continue, you can define this using the if conditional statement.
# In this example, the setup, build, and test jobs run in series, with build and test being dependent on the successful completion of the job that precedes them:#
